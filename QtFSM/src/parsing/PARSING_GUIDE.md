# QtFSM Parsing System Developer Guide

This document provides a technical overview of the **Reverse Engineering** engine in QtFSM. It now parses the **config-based C++ output** generated by the Codegen module.

## Current Pipeline

```
C++ Config Code -> CodeParser -> FSM Model
```

## What Gets Parsed

- `cfg.initial` for the initial state ID
- `cfg.states["..."] = StateConfig{ ... }` blocks
- Transition lists inside each StateConfig

## Strict Format

`CodeParser` expects the exact formatting structure produced by the generator. Manual edits or alternative layouts are not supported.

## Notes

Legacy C++ class parsing components (`Lexer`, `CppParser`, `ModelBuilder`) remain for research and debugging but are not used in the main application flow.
